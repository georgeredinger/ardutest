                                    Ardutest
                    A unit testing mock library for Arduino.

                                 -- Overview --
This library is maintained by engineers at Mind Studios, and provided free of
charge for the benefit of the community. Its primary focus is on providing a set
of mocks that can be used to test Arduino-based code on a development machine by
enabling cross compilation without modifying the source. The library relies on
GNU libc, and is known to work on Linux. The unit tests for the mock objects are
written for CppUTest (http://www.cpputest.org), but the objects themselves 
should be useable in any C++ test suite.

                               -- Contributing --
Code contributions are welcome! We want to make this library as useful as
possible. We prefer to have code submitted either as a git diff to Nick Pascucci
(npascut1@gmail.com), or as a pull request on GitHub.
